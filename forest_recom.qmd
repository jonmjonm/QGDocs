Metropolized Forest Recom [@autry2023metropolized,@autry2021metropolized] is an extension of the Recom (or Recombination) algorithm developed by DeFord, Duchin, and Solomon [@deford2019recombination]. It modifies the original, whose stationary measure is unknown, to an algorithm that is computational feasible to use as a proposal for a Metropolis-Hastings scheme. This gives the user better knowledge of what measure the ensample of maps has been drawn from and how they prioritize various legal and cultural norms in redistricting.
