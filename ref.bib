                  (MicroPress Inc., Forest Hills, NY;
                  http://www.micropress-inc.com/), interprets native
                  \TeX\ source code and generates an equation as an
                  OLE picture object that can then be cut and pasted
                  directly into Word. This editor, however, does not
                  handle \LaTeX\ environments (such as
                  \texttt{\{array\}} or \texttt{\{eqnarray\}}); it can
                  interpret only \TeX\ codes. Thus, when there's a
                  choice, we ask that you avoid these \LaTeX\ calls in
                  displayed math --- for example, that you use the
                  \TeX\ \verb+\matrix+ command for ordinary matrices,
                  rather than the \LaTeX\ \texttt{\{array\}}
                  environment.}
