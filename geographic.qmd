## JSON Adjacency Files

These are the basic formate used to hold the Adjacency file or dual graph for a region to be redistricted. It is based on the JSON output of the NetworkX Python library. An example for a 4x4 grid here [grid_graph_4_by_4.json](Geo/Adjacency/grid_graph_4_by_4.json). 

Such a file contains  list of the nodes/vertices as a list under `node`. A sample node entry is
```JSON
    {
        "node_name": "(0,0)",
        "id": 0,
        "border_length": 2,
        "x_location": 0,
        "y_location": 0,
        "area": 1,
        "population": 1,
        "county": "A"
    }
```
where the `id`, `area`, `population` and `border_length` are required. They give the name by which the vertex/node are referred to as well as the `area` and `population` of the partition unit associated to the vertex/node. `border_length` entry give the length of the external boundary of the partition unit associated to the vertex/node. Hence of a vertex/node is interior this number is zero. The precise labels can be different than these as the name mapping to each piece of data can be specified at runtime.

One can also encode additional information. This example gives a node name in `node_name`, a location in the plane to help with plotting in `x_location` and `y_location`. It also records which county the node is in. This example uses fictitious county names of "A" and "B". Additionally, the vote count for each party in a collection of elections is also often included. 

After the list of noted, there is an `adjacency` entry which contains one list for each of the vertices/nodes. The first list under `adjacency` gives the vertices/nodes that are adjacent to the first vertex/node listed above. 

For example of the second entry in the adjacency list is the following list, then the 2nd note is adjacent to the 4th and 5th node listed with a boundary whose length is respectively one and two units.
```JSON
{
    {
    "id": 4,
    "length": 1
    },
    {
    "id": 5,
    "length": 2
    }
}
```
