This site gives introductions to some of the tools developed by the *Duke Quantifying Gerrymandering* group. The group, headed by [Jonathan C. Mattingly](https://sites.math.duke.edu/~jonm/) and [Gregory J. Herschlag](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/gjh), works to understand how to assess the degree to which political districts capture the will of the people in the elections in which they are used.  More information see the groups [blog](https://sites.duke.edu/quantifyinggerrymandering/).
